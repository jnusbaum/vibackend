BMI	Lose Weight: strive to lose 1-2 pounds per week by reducing your intake by 500-1000 calories each day. Healthy eating and regular physical activity are keys to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. Eat wisely and choose a variety of low-calorie, high nutrition foods and beverages in the basic food groups. Consider getting on a weight maintenance program consisting of dietary therapy, physical activity, and behavior therapy. Regularly update your VI to track progress.
RHR	A heart rate is considered normal if the resting rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Research has found that a resting heart rate near the top of the 60 to 100 range can increase your risk for cardiovascular disease and even early death. Keeping your cholesterol levels in check is one way to lower your heart rate. High levels restrict blood flow through the arteries and damage blood vessels, which can make your heart beat faster than normal to move blood through the body. Another reliable way to lower your resting heart rate is to exercise. Even small amounts of exercise can make a change. However, the intensity of the exercise is key. One study found that just one hour per week of high-intensity aerobic training (about 66% of maximum effort) lowered RHR more efficiently than a low-intensity effort (33% of max effort).
DIA	Commit to losing some weight. Blood pressure often increases as weight increases. Being overweight also can cause disrupted breathing while you sleep (sleep apnea), which further raises your blood pressure. Weight loss is one of the most effective lifestyle changes for controlling blood pressure. In general, you may reduce your blood pressure by about 1 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) with each kilogram (about 2.2 pounds) of weight you lose.

DAYSEX	Try to be active most days of the week since physical activity has broad health benefits. Guidelines suggest to aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day. But even if you don't have 30 minutes, being active for some time is better than not being active at all.

For optimal results, aim to spend a total of 60 seconds on each stretching exercise.

This would be similar to the number of hours worked in Denmark, consistently one of the world’s happiest countries. Research shows that productivity falls sharply after 50 hours per week, and drops off a cliff after 55 hours. Additionally, not taking at least one full day off per week leads to lower hourly output overall.
